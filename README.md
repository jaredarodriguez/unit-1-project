//Premise: 
Youâ€™re a guitarist, playing a massive gig to a sold out venue until all of a sudden your pedalboard connection acts up. The crowd is brutal and with each passing second gets angrier and angirer with your technical difficulties. Your bandmates start yelling at you. Yikes! 

Act quick and inspect your pedals to locate the issue. One of the cords insn't plugged in, disrupting the circuit. Complete teh connection by clicking around to find which input is faulty.//
